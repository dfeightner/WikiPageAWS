                    <br>
                    <h2>What is AWS Cloudfront?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html#:~:text=CloudFront%20delivers%20your%20content%20through,with%20the%20best%20possible%20performance.">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've defined—such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        As an example, suppose that you're serving an image from a traditional web server, not from CloudFront. For example, you might serve an image, sunsetphoto.png, using the URL https://example.com/sunsetphoto.png.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your users can easily navigate to this URL and see the image. But they probably don't know that their request is routed from one network to another—through the complex collection of interconnected networks that comprise the internet—until the image is found.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user request through the AWS backbone network to the edge location that can best serve your content. Typically, this is a CloudFront edge server that provides the fastest delivery to the viewer. Using the AWS network dramatically reduces the number of networks that your users' requests must pass through, which improves performance. Users get lower latency—the time it takes to load the first byte of the file—and higher data transfer rates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your files (also known as objects) are now held (or cached) in multiple edge locations around the world.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h2>Pricing</h2>
                    <p>
                        CloudFront charges for data transfers out from its edge locations, along with HTTP or HTTPS requests. Pricing varies by usage type, geographical region, and feature selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data transfer from your origin to CloudFront is always free when using AWS origins like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon API Gateway. You are only billed for the outbound data transfer from CloudFront to the viewer when using AWS origins.
                    </p>
